------ tool for SCA

https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action

I'm not sure if this is official from GitHub, but it uses GHAS in the backend.

Looks like there is this as well, from GitHub official docs:
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/configuring-the-dependency-review-action

Ohhh apparently it's the same.

The action uses the endpoint. So maybe I can make a demo of the endpoint as well:

And set up the code scanning results direclty on GitHub.


------ tool for DAST

to run DAST locally (which can be useful, instead of having to run on GitHub Actions everytime)...
do the following:

docker 

gradlew.bat build
gradlew.bat run

run on powershell:
docker run --rm -t -v "$(pwd)/zap-report:/zap/wrk" zaproxy/zap-stable  zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:7070 -a -m 5 -r report.html

with rules:
docker run --rm -t -v "$(pwd)/zap-report:/zap/wrk" zaproxy/zap-stable  zap-baseline.py -t http://host.docker.internal:7070 -a -m 5 -r report.html -c rules.tsv
* remember to run the app first!


------

add package management
- put package into container registry


------

to run trivy locally

trivy image gcr.io/distroless/java21-debian12

------

for the trivy run, we rebuild the image. ideally, we should use the image we pushed to
 the registry, but it didn't work for me.


------

for tomorrow (February 13th)

- make sure the DAST and Trivy are passing
