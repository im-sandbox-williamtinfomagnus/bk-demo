I'm not sure if this is official from GitHub, but it uses GHAS in the backend.

Looks like there is this as well, from GitHub official docs:
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/manage-your-dependency-security/configuring-the-dependency-review-action

Ohhh apparently it's the same.

The action uses the endpoint. So maybe I can make a demo of the endpoint as well:
